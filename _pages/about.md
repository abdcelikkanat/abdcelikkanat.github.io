I am currently an assistant professor in the [DKW group](https://www.cs.aau.dk/research/dkw-data-knowledge-and-web-engineering) of the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.aau.dk/) at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/), where my research focuses on genome representation learning models. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the the [Section for Cognitive Section](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys) at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english), working on the structure and dynamics of complex networks under the guidance of Prof. [Sune Lehmann](https://www.sunelehmann.com/) and Prof. [Morten Mørup](http://www.mortenmorup.dk/).

I obtained my Ph.D. at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/), under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. [Fragkiskos Malliaros](https://fragkiskos.me/) and Prof. [Nikos Paragios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7edhlaQAAAAJ). During my doctoral studies, I worked on the random walk-based graph representation learning methods at the [Centre for Visual Computing](https://cvn.centralesupelec.fr/) lab and in the [Inria OPIS](https://opis-inria.eu/) team. Before my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from [Boğaziçi University](https://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US). 

[//]: # (My Master’s thesis, supervised by Prof. [Ali Taylan Cemgil]&#40;https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/&#41;, explored random graphs with prescribed degree distributions and their applications.)
